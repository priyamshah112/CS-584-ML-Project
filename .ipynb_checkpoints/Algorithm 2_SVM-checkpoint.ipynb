      "1. 3 weeks ago, I had the pleasure of writing an article I’d dreamed of writing for months and months on end. Gyft Adds Walmart Gift Cards!! Alas, all good things are not meant to last. For the last 3 weeks, Bitcoiners around the country have had the pleasure of buying Walmart gift cards with Bitcoin, receiving 3% back in the form of Gyft points, and in essence spending Bitcoin at Walmart on gas and groceries. Making Bitcoin a cheaper option to buy gas has been a long standing dream of the Bitcoin community, this was the first step towards realizing that dream and said step has now been reversed. Despite the loss of Walmart, Gyft is geared to provide more to smaller businesses with the launch of Gyft Cloud. Gyft informed customers via email that \"due to reasons outside of Gyft’s control” they are unable to stock Walmart gift cards any longer. The Bitcoin community knows full well that Vinny at Gyft would not unlist Walmart Gift cards from Gyft’s impressive registry unless he was forced to. There is no doubt in my mind that the initial decision that has culminated in today’s end of Gyft’s support of Walmart was originally made in Arkansas at Walmart HQ. Walmart Gift cards are no longer available for BitcoinAmazon Also Shuns Bitcoin UseAs Jason Del Ray wrote in his Recode article on Amazon saying no to accepting Bitcoin:Amazon isn’t alone in this stance among big e-commerce sites. EBay, Walmart.com, Target.com and other big names have shown no signs of moving toward acceptance. Probably the most well-known online seller to accept the digital currency is Overstock.com, which sells furniture online and has a comparatively modest market cap of $413 million. Compared to Overstock and Tigerdirect, Amazon and Walmart are much much larger. It seems that they have both dismissed Bitcoin as an annoying fly, not worthy of real attention. Amazon’s Payment Team head Tom Taylor also told Recode that:\"…we’re not hearing from customers that it’s right for them and don’t have any plans within Amazon to engage bitcoin.”As revealed by industry sources close to Amazon and hinted at by Amazon’s Payment Team, Amazon may be stepping into the financial sphere soon to contend with Visa/Mastercard/AMEX/Paypal, as opposed to just paying their usurious fees. Some readers will remember that Amazon previously released Amazoncoins as part of a QE program to stimulate app development for their Kindles. Amazon seems to have turned their back on Bitcoin; however, they are clearly still open to the concept of \"Digital Currency.”  Facebook just might be the same way\n",

      "2. Walmart has developed a blockchain pilot focused on China's massive pork industry supply chain. Built in collaboration with IBM and Beijing's Tsinghua University, the pilot is part of two separate, but parallel pushes by Walmart and the Chinese government to make supply chain data more accurate, and therefore safer. IBM's head of global supply chain solutions, Paul Chang, explained that the pilot, if implemented, could also give Walmart a bigger slice of China's lucrative pork industry. Chang told CoinDesk: \"It's not just important for China, but for Walmart to really succeed in China. It is the most consumed meat of the most populous country in the world.\"China is expected to consume 54.6 million tons of pork this year, according to a recent USDA report, and that's a slight decrease from original forecasts due to rising prices. For example, a Wharton study last year found that China's high domestic pork prices are tied directly to food safety concerns — which is where the Walmart pilot comes in. The blockchain prototype was announced today as Walmart opened its new Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. The office is intended to promote a more transparent food system in China, blockchain included. Starting from scratchTo build the pilot, a Walmart team in China comprised of supply chain staffers, logistics and food safety experts partnered with Tsinghua University's National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies. Constructed using technology from the Hyperledger blockchain project, the pilot is being positioned as a way to ensure the accuracy of farm origination details; batch numbers; factory and processing data; expiration dates; storage temperatures; and shipping details. In the beginning, the pilot will be run on three nodes, one managed by IBM, one by Walmart and another by an unnamed supplier Chang said didn't want to be disclosed. But to give an idea of how large these suppliers can be, Chang, a 15-year veteran of supply chain traceability, said that by the time the project scales to 10 nodes, the industry could save \"billions of dollars\". That's because when food is sold to a consumer at a Walmart store, each individual item will have been authenticated using the blockchain system to create a transparent and secure record. According to a statement, a record created in the distributed ledger can also help the retailer better manage the shelf-life of it products in individual stores. Safer supply chainsFollowing multiple reports of contamination in both China's food and drug industries, the China Food and Drug Administration earlier this year proposed the adoption of measures to improve product traceability. While the push for more stringent supply chain controls by the government was cited in today's statement as a \"critical step\" toward helping eliminate contamination, increased regulation is usually accompanied by higher prices. In May, regulation of China's baby-milk powder industry was credited for increased competition and decreasing revenue in a South China Morning Post report. Though Walmart doesn't break down its revenue numbers by country in its annual report, a Reuters article last year indicated that the retailer was falling short of its plans for China to account for a quarter of its global retail growth. With an estimated $1tn to be saved by moving global supply chain to a blockchain, Walmart stands to not only help China makes its food safer, but cut corners on cost. Mangoes and beyondBut Chang said IBM is already well advanced in another effort that implements lessons learned from the project in a totally different industry. He described an unannounced project currently underway to transport mangos as \"slightly smaller in scope\" but \"much broader in terms of the number of agencies\".\"We are starting this with a pretty big splash doing pork in China,\" said Chang. \"But we already have plans to launch into a multinational plan to track mangos from south American to the US.\"From there, he expects IBM and its competitors in the blockchain supply chain space to move from one commodity to another. He concluded:\"This is the missing link that I think could finally encourage the industry to adopt this technology for the benefit of efficient trades and the benefit of the consumers they serve.\"Piglets image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies\n",

      "3. A new patent filing finds retail giant Walmart seeking to utilize blockchain technology to perfect a smarter package delivery tracking system. In an application released by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Thursday, Walmart describes a \"smart package\" that would include a device which would record information on a blockchain regarding the contents of the package, its environmental conditions, its location and more. It also suggests that its smart package could be used in tandem with other emerging technologies including \"autonomous vehicles,\" such as drones. The patent was first submitted in August of 2017, and notably builds on a filing Walmart submitted for a blockchain-based drone package delivery tracking system last year. Walmart explains in the filing that online shopping has created shipping challenges for retailers, particularly with regard to perishable products requiring temperature control, thus necessitating further innovation. Walmart writes in the application:\"These online customers many times seek to purchase items that may require a controlled environment and further seek to have greater security in the shipping packaging that the items are shipped in.\"The application states that the blockchain component will be encrypted into the device, and will have \"key addresses along the chain of [the package's] custody, including hashing with a seller private key address, a courier private key address and a buyer private key address.\"In addition to its delivery drone aspirations, Walmart has sought to apply blockchain technology to other areas of its business. Last year, it joined Kroger, Nestle and other food industry firms in a partnership with IBM to use the blockchain to improve food traceability. It backed a similar effort in China with JD.com in December.

      "4. Global retail giant Walmart hosted a presentation on its work with blockchain during an annual investor event last week. The company began working with IBM and Tsinghua University of Beijing last year to test blockchain-based supply chain applications, with a particular focus on China's massive pork market. In follow-up statements, Walmart indicated it wanted to apply the tech to various areas – and more recently, CoinDesk reported the company is looking at blockchain as a tracking solution for unmanned delivery vehicles. The results of the initial trial, though, will arguably set the tenor for Walmart's use of blockchain, and according to the firm, its food-focused testing has produced \"very encouraging\" results. And this is only the beginning, according to Walmart, which said of the presentation:\"This is just the start of our blockchain exploration. We plan to continue to test the technology, by including more data attributes, for example. And we will continue to test how we can use it to improve food traceability and transparency by collaborating with others throughout the supply chain. This means farmers and suppliers and other retailers.\"Walmart explained that the technology has helped it reduced the time it takes to track food from days to minutes, enabling more effective response in the event that tainted products are discovered.\"This will help enable precise and rapid recalls to preserve consumer trust in the food industry, while increasing traceability and transparency of the food system,\" the firm said.

      "5. Mobile gift card provider Gyft has announced via an email to its customers that it no longer offers users the ability to purchase Walmart gift cards on its platform. Gyft, which accepts bitcoin and provides 3% 'Gyft points' back to digital currency buyers, added the US retail giant to its network on 24th March to great fanfare, as Walmart was long one of the most requested retailers by Gyft users. The company informed customers of the change in its offerings via a 14th April email. Read the message: \"Due to circumstances beyond our control, we need to remove Walmart from our list of participating retailers, effective April 13, 2014. Rest assured that we are doing everything in our power to bring them back up as soon as possible.\"Gyft and its CEO Vinny Lingham have been outspoken about their support for bitcoin, with Lingham most recently penning a lengthy post on how bitcoin played a key role in the growth of the company. The San Francisco-based company began accepting bitcoin in May 2013 through a partnership with BitPay. More detailsThough new buyers won't be able to purchase Walmart gift cards, Gyft indicated that existing Walmart gift cards purchased on its platform can still be redeemed. The company, long one of bitcoin's most supportive companies in the wider tech ecosystem, stressed that bitcoin users who were dissatisfied with the decision should get in touch with Walmart regarding the matter. Said the email message:\"If you are as disappointed as we are about this decision by Walmart, please email them at help@walmart.com and let them know how you feel about it.\"Gyft will continue talks with WalmartSpeaking to CoinDesk, Lingham indicated that Gyft would seek to learn more about the decision and to continue to speak to Walmart about relisting its gift cards. Still, Lingham wasn't optimistic that the retailer's policy would change. Said Lingham:\"We will continue to talk to them, but it's a giant organization... I can't speak to their reasoning at this stage.\"As pointed out in the email, however, Gyft still provides bitcoin users access to a number of mainstream merchants. Notably, this includes Minnesota-based retail giant Target, the third-largest in the US, which joined the Gyft network in November.

      "6. Trying to make pork products in China safer was just the first step of Walmart's global plans for blockchain. The pilot unveiled last week uses technology from the Hyperledger project to track pork shipping information, including farm origination details, batch numbers and storage temperatures on a secure blockchain. Over the months ahead, the retail giant wants to expand on that work. Walmart vice president of global food safety Frank Yiannas told CoinDesk that, in anticipation of a successful pilot launch, the company is already looking to the future for other applications. Yiannas told CoinDesk: \"We will immediately work to identify additional food products where we might utilize blockchain to enhance our ability to track and trace them.\"If successful, the project could improve accountability on a major supply chain (pork is China's most popular meat product). Walmart is undertaking the project in partnership with IBM and Tsinghua University in Beijing. Following the completion of the trial, Yiannas said Walmart will work with IBM on additional applications, including other supply chains that could be tracked via blockchain. Blockchain side-effectsBut it's not just healthier food that Yiannas believes will be among the final results of building blockchain into a number of industries in China and around the world. Yiannas says the safer conditions resulting from a more transparent, accurate record of supply chain transactions on a blockchain could have an overall impact on the Walmart brand. He remarked:\"Examples of the benefits could include safer food, enhanced consumer trust, enhanced flow to provide fresher products to customers, fresher and faster deliveries could reduce food waste in the home, and more.\"The $213b global retailer has long been working to ensure that products which reach its stores meet certain standards, but continues to face related lawsuits. Walmart was sued earlier this year because cheese products it sold allegedly contained wood pulp, and last year the retailer settled charges over a corn starch it sold that claimed to be \"all natural\" but actually included genetically modified material.

      "9. A recently released filing by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlines a blockchain-based framework that Walmart has envisioned as part of its efforts to expand its digital services for retail shoppers. Walmart’s Blockchain PushFiled in 2017 and granted on May 17, 2018, the document is an example of Walmart’s push to embrace digital technologies for augmenting its intellectual property holdings, and it adds to an impressive arsenal featuring a number ranging from parcel-tracking systems to IoT. As per the document, Walmart’s proposed system enables the tracking of retail products brought by a customer. This is achieved by allowing a customer (storehouses or retail) to \"register” a product after purchase, choosing a defined price for resale to individuals, while using Walmart’s framework as a digital marketplace. As stated in the patent:\"The increasing competition from ‘non-traditional shopping mechanisms’ as an incentive for ‘bricks and mortar’ retailers to stay ahead of new technologies that could improve customer experience.”Furthermore, the patent specifies that the innovation is not limited to retailers, as individual customers often use an item for a limited period and wish to sell it later on. However, this involves low-awareness on how to execute the sale, as customers are \"left to their own devices to arrange for a subsequent resale.”Walmart has filed to patent a blockchain-based digital marketplaceHowever, the described platform is said to provide \"additional support to greatly ease and facilitate their later reselling of items,” while encompassing a variety of interfaces such as web browsers, mobile platforms, or a physical point-of-sale. The proposal is similar to a recently filed patent, which described the retail giant’s intentions to power up a fleet of delivery vans via the blockchain. However, the latest patent details a \"distributed delivery record blockchain,” which updates every transaction as the products are purchased in bulk, sold to customers, and handled by couriers. The Blockchain MechanismFor making a transaction, the seller and courier are required to provide their private keys. Once matched, the transaction is instantly broadcast to the network, though it may require verification from the buyer, seller, and courier, prior to being added to the blockchain. Later, when the buyer collects the package, the courier is expected to utilize their private key for confirming the handover, which immediately updates the blockchain with the transaction, and marks the end of the purchase cycle. It remains to be seen whether Walmart’s vision will become a reality, though, as the firm has filed for a number of blockchain patents over the years but has been hesitant to merge them into its day-to-day operations\n",
