      "Text: why did one of techcrunchs longestserving editors leave a media giant for a bitcoin startup for outgoing east coast editor john biggs the answer is that hes been leading one already in his spare time for the last year peertopeer payments startup freemit has been biggs passion project since december 2014 and the company has since raised more than 150000 from angel investors according to data from crunchbase still biggs is just now making the leap to freemit fulltime leaving his job late last month at a company hed been with for nearly 10 years according to biggs it was now or never i basically quit because i knew that first off startups are either time consuming or theyre not and if you dont make them timeconsuming you lose focus i figured its time for a bit more hustle its time for more focus he told coindesk biggs suggested his departure was due to his confidence in the freemit product the team that built it and the size of the opportunity he believes the bitcoin industry has to disrupt financial incumbents biggs saidwere in a bind right now because banks arent going to change to support the things we want them to support especially faster crossborder payments they already make a lot of money and are quoteunquote good at it my concern is theyre going to keep status quo until someone changes that status quoin interview biggs went on to suggest that the move is likely to precede a period of more frequent announcements from the stealth startup which he said could soon open to users biggs said freemit could open to an initial batch of as many as 7000 beta users this month as part of what he called a staged rollout he indicated that freemit is watching the ongoing block size debate and that the uncertainties surrounding potential changes to bitcoins transaction capacity could be a factor in such decisionmaking although he doesnt see a longterm issue with the current state of the network further he defended the technology in face of new criticism stating that the debates ensnaring the bitcoin community are comparable to challenges faced and ultimately overcome by early internet innovators freemits approachperhaps unsurprisingly biggs is bullish on freemits ability to emerge as a major disruptive startup not just in bitcoin but in fintech to hit a larger target market he said freemit wont emphasize denominating transactions in bitcoin as a currency instead targeting new users who may be more familiar with traditional banking products and online payment startups such as paypalthe big difference is were a hybrid model biggs said most of the team has worked in banks so theyre well versed in how those systems work instead of going bitcoin first were connecting multiple paths until bitcoin becomes liquidbiggs described this approach as contrary to the industrys bestfunded crossborder bitcoin payments startup abra which has raised 14m in venture capital to date abra uses a network of tellers who serve to take the place of physical kiosks biggs lauded the model as an uber for cash but suggested that freemit will not take a similar approach to its service prioritizing fiat in fiat out money movement to start biggs said freemit intends to target international students and younger payments product users comparing the functionality to that of align commerce which helps small businesses send fiat transactions abroad using the blockchain role reversaloverall biggs expressed enthusiasm at his changing role in the tech industry nothing that hes followed entrepreneurs for years in his techcrunch role where he joined less than a year after the publication began biggs said that he sees his past experience in media as an asset to the startup and that so far he hasnt had trouble making the transition to his ceo rolei think the experience of managing a distributed team and my media savvy is going to be useful he said he added that certain aspects such as raising funding were less fun than he expected them to be but that his family and friends are supportive of the transitionnobodys said that im stupid to do it biggs said my wife is even ok with itfor his part biggs has been a vocal supporter of the industry driving coverage of the industry at techcrunch and contributing posts about his experiences on the funding trail to coindesk biggs suggested hell continue to blog for techcrunch as he builds out the startup but that he is already learning to love his entrepreneur role concludingi can understand why people can get addicted to itjohn biggs image via techcrunchthe leader in blockchain news coindesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies\n",

      "Text: when us authorities busted up the silk road and arrested alleged kingpin ross ulbricht last fall it didnt mean the end of online drugsforbitcoin markets alternative trading posts popped up immediately and existing ones expanded to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers however the sites have been rocked by thefts more arrests and other troubles leading some customers and even investigators to wax nostalgic about the original dread pirate roberts as silk roads founder called himself one customer who goes by the nickname hugs wrote in a message to coindeskchaos is the word that i would choose to describe the landscape as it has morphed and changed after silkroads seizure many sites have come and gone  many of them developing quite a following before being shut down or hacked buyers and vendors alike have been on a constant search for a stable market one that will be around for longer than a couple of monthsone law enforcement source said the new markets are barely worth investigating at this point he raised februarys heist of thousands of bitcoins from silk road 20 as an example of bad managementwhen the original dread was running it that never happened its not being run as wellthe law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was involved in the original silk road investigation but now is just keeping an eye on silk road 20 in the background in fact hes not sure any law enforcement agencies are making silk road 20 or other online drug markets a priority silk road 20s first admin styled himself as dread pirate roberts just as ulbricht is alleged to have done but he disappeared from the scene after three of the sites alleged moderators were arrested in december and the sites new administrator calls himself defcon users dont know who to trustother sites to position themselves as silk road alternatives include the sheep marketplace black market reloaded utopia agora pandora bluesky and many others some of these sites have shut down others are still accessible on the deep web via the tor browser bitcoinbranded ecstasy pills image via wwwpillreportscomof the current crop hugs named agora as the most stable saying its administrators appear to be working diligently to gain user trust but so far no wouldbe mastermind seems to be able to fill the shoes of the original dread pirate roberts for one thing many have failed to keep users bitcoins safe in addition to the silk road 20 theft another deep web trading post sheep marketplace reported a 6m heist and shut down in late 2013 in march the market known as pandora reported a theft of 250000 in bitcoin promised repayment and stayed open because of the anonymous nature of these markets its difficult for users to know if the sites were really hacked or if the administrators just absconded with their bitcoins the law enforcement source addedeither the administrators dont have the level of expertise or the dedication to the web site that the original dpr did or it could be that theyre running a scamusers have tried following bitcoin movements through the block chain for clues but that is probably a futile pursuit according to university of californiasan diego cryptographer sarah meiklejohn she wrote in an emailit would be difficult to verify just from block chain analysis if a theft were carried out by external thieves or by the owners of the service since the movement of the bitcoins would presumably be the same either way if you saw the bitcoins deposited into an exchange and then asked that exchange who the realworld owner of that account was you might learn something but 1 thats not something that most users can do and 2 operators of dark marketplaces are almost certainly not using their real names anyway so basically that doesnt seem possiblethis leads users to be a bit jumpy when a market has a temporary outage threads pop up on reddit speculating whether the sites organizers have taken the money and run when sheep marketplace claimed it was robbed users had already been speculating for days that a scam was in the works since they had been unable to withdraw bitcoins from their accounts the aftermath of hackssilk road 20 administrators appear to be making good on promises to reimburse users for losses following the alleged transaction malleability attack that hit the site in february defcon posted on the sites forums in early april that half the victims had been fully repaid and that 100 had received at least a partial payment he set 9th june as a rough target for full repayment a screenshot of silk road 20 user balances from admin defcon image via motherboarda number of silk road 20 users commented in the forum that they had indeed received payment however a few said they had received nothing as of early april in turn many users have not yet logged in to claim their reimbursement according to the sites administrator other markets have handled things far differently sheep marketplaces admins vanished after claiming theft and the admin of project black flag openly admitted pocketing users bitcoins when he shut down the market last fallit makes us realize once again how cool and proper ross ulbricht allegedly was he could have fleeced people but instead he empowered people sad loss reddit user bitchrome commented in a discussion about the sheep marketplace shutdown another reddit user jamdiam sounded fed up with postsilk road marketsi dont eff with these markets anymore for two reasons 1 theyre clearly crawling with feds 2 the management of these sites will never match the original dpr aka ross ulbrichtross ulbricht denies the fbi allegations and is currently in a new york detention centre awaiting trial improving securityto prevent future thefts defcon removed silk road 20s centralized escrow system writing on the markets forum that centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers and a huge target for dishonest administratorsinstead defcon said the market will move to a multisignature escrow system in which a single person cannot move funds without agreement from one or more other signers blackbank cannabis road cloudnine darkbay hydra the marketplace and tor bazaar are all listed as multisig markets on the darknetmarkets subreddit dark market shopper hugs clarifiedi think that within the next year we will see multisignature escrow become the standard for markets across the board vendors are tired of having their hardearned money stolen or hacked as are users there are enough stressors in this business without the constant worry of dishonest or incompetent market admins to add to the listhugs added my hope is that multisignature escrow will work to alleviate the fear of market scams although traditional escrow is currently much less complicated and more convenient for the average buyer i think well soon begin to see multisig simplified and implemented in a way that even the most technologically deficient buyers such as myself can still take advantage of its benefitsof course if the illegal marketplaces succeed in gaining customer trust  and as a result higher sales  they will also become a much larger target for law enforcementi dont know how much interest law enforcement has in silk road 20 right now when they get up and start running hard maybe theyll start taking a harder look at it said the silk road

Given a query text, the code preprocesses it, vectorizes it, and uses the trained KNN model to find the 10 most similar articles in the dataset. The code also calculates and prints the analysis parameters, which include the number of similar articles, mean similarity score, and standard deviation of similarity score."
